<div class="gg-fttxt">(April 05, 2024) <p>The sweetest woman we've ever known, Geraldine Delores (DeSimone) Letkiewicz, loving mother and devoted wife, passed on to her heavenly home on April 2, 2024. She was greatly loved and will be forever missed by her children Raymond (Janice) Letkiewicz Jr., Viola (Robert) Gross, Robert Letkiewicz, Anthony (Carol) Letkiewicz, and Jacob (Lisa) Letkiewicz.<br>
<br>
Geraldine was born on December 2, 1930, in Erie, PA to parents Antonio DeSimone and Angelina Rose (Santos) DeSimone who immigrated to America in 1894.<br>
<br>
She married her husband Raymond Letkiewicz twice, (eloping a month before their planned wedding) and enjoyed 53 years of marriage. Raymond passed away in 2009 and was surely waiting for his love with open arms.<br>
<br>
She was preceded in death by her sister Pearl, brothers Alvin and Donald. She is survived by her children, grandchildren, and one brother, David (Jean) DeSimone.<br>
<br>
Geraldine was grandmother to 13 grandchildren, all were at her bedside as she transitioned, and 13 great- grandchildren.<br>
<br>
"Gerry" loved silent movies, Lone Ranger was her favorite, gossip magazines, and family parties. Fond memories of Gerry include her second to none spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna. She was the last of the first generation in the Letkiewicz family and will forever live on in the hearts of all who knew her.<br>
<br>
Internment at Laurel Hill Cemetery, Erie, PA was private at Gerry's request.<br>
<br>
Love you always...until we meet again.</p>
