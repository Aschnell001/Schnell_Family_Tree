<div class="gg-fttxt">(26 Sep 2014) <p>Ralph Keiler (or Keeler) emigrated from England to Connecticut in 1635 or 1636. He was a builder and a contractor and one of the founders of both Hartford, where he was granted a lot for a home in 1639, and Norwalk, where he later moved.<br>
<br>
Ralph&#39;s father is thought to have been another Ralph Keiler (or Keeler), but that is not proven and his mother is unknown. His first wife and mother of his children is also unknown. He married 2nd Mrs. Sarah (Howes) Whelply, widow of Henry, in 1663. They had no issue.<br>
<br>
Ralph had seven children by his first wife:<br>
1. Isabel, b. abt. 1648; m. Thomas Morehouse<br>
2. Rebecca, bapt. Feb. 9, 1650/1651 at Hartford; M. Benjamin Turney<br>
3. John, b. abt. 1652; m. June 18, 1679, Mehitable Rockwell<br>
4. Ralph, b. abt. 1653; m. Grace Lindall<br>
5. Samuel, b. 1656<br>
6. Jonah, b. abt. 1658<br>
7. Elizabeth, b. abt. 1660; m. July 17, 1673, James Pickett.<br>
<br>
Ralph and other Norwalk founders were buried in the town&#39;s first graveyard, now the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery, but stones were not available for markers. A memorial monument in the cemetery shows their names. He is listed as, &#34;Ralph Keiler&#34; (see Memorial #5017). He is also shown on the founders memorial in the Ancient Burying Ground in Hartford, CT.<br>
