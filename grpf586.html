<div class="gg-fttxt"><p>"Thomas Tracy was the second son of Deacon Jedidiah and Margaret Rix Tracy. He was born at Preston, Conn 8 Sept 1724, per Preston Town Records. He married 28 Feb 1754 to Lucy Sprague according to Sharon, Conn. Town records. She was born 28 July 1735, the daughter of Ebenezer and Elizabeth Thatcher-Sprague of Lebanon, Conn. According to the Lebanon Town Records they had a daughter, Ruth born 15 May 1737. In 1768 Thomas Tracy came to Lenox, Mass, settling on a farm on East Street. He was then about 44 years of age, having passed his pioneer novitiate elsewhere. It is recorded that in 1758 he was admitted to Rev. Thomas Allen's church in Pittsfield, Mass. Then for a short time he seems to have been in Sharon, Conn. Coming to Lenox when he did he became, by dismissal from the church in Pittsfield, one of the foundation members of the Lenox Congregational Church. This statement is made by the Rev. Dr. Shepard in his "Semi-Centennial Sermon." He also says that the church, at the time of its organization, consisted of nine male members bearing the name of Tracy, plus others. The Lenox church records give evidence that its members occasionally strayed from the path of recititude, for they contain such notes as this: "Thomas Tracy made acknowledgement of intemperance before the church and congregation. Also received certificate from Rev. Thomas Allen, of Pittsfield, saying that Thomas Tracy had there made christian satisfaction for some breaches of gospel rule, of which he had been guilty while a member with them. The same was accepted of this church." Thomas Tracy brought complaint against another church member for the same offence. Thomas Tracy's only recorded purchase of land in Lenox is listed as on 23 April 1768 for two tracts or parcells of land lying and being in the township of Lenox, Berkshire, Massachusetts Bay. Also one piece containing 90 acres adjoining North on Quincy's grant East on the Highway, Southerly on Nathan Mead's Land; other peice contains 10 acres and is butted northerly on Jone's land." The earliest mention of Thomas Tracy in Lenox Town Records is in 1771, when at an annual town meeting, 14 Mar 1775, he was again tithingman and hog reeve. The town records show the birth of two of his children: Thomas Rix Tracy son to Thomas Tracy and Lucy his wife b. 29 Oct 1770; Philinda Tracy, daughter to Thomas Tracy and Lucy his wife, born 8 Sept 1773. The church records show baptisms: 19 May 1771 baptized Thomas Rix Tracy son of Thomas Tracy; 19 Sept 1773 baptized Philinda, daughter of Thomas Tracy. Meantime the revolutionary war had begun. Before the actual breaking out of hostilities the people of Berkshire, foreseeing what was coming, had, in the county Congress, held at Stockbridge 6 July 1774, adopted the solemn league and covenant. A firm determination was manifested not to import or consume English goods until Parliament had righted the wrongs to the colonists. The Non-Consumtion and Non-Importation Agreement adopted at Stockbridge was generally circulated through the county and presumably generally signed, but the only copy preserved, with the original signatures, is that signed in Lenox, dated 16 July 1774 and is now hanging in the Sedgwick Library inthat town. Among the signers of that agreement was Thomas Tracy. His patriotic zeal was recognized by his townsmen when in 1776 on March 12, he ws chosen a member of the Committee of Correspondence. The Lenox town records fail to disclose the date of Thomas Tracy's death. The Congregational Church records have an entry that reads as follows: "Thomas Tracy jjoined in 1769 from church in Pittsfield. Died in 1776." The only other record that hs come to light is a memorandum in a ledger which belonged to Thomas Rix Tracy, son of Thomas, reading as follows: "Thomas Tracy, father of Thomas R Tracy, died May 1777 in Lenox Mass., aged 55 years." The ledger in which this entry was made was purchased in 1793 and the record is not a contemporareous one. It is evidently from memory, as the precise dayis not given. At the time of Thomas Tracy's death, probate business was practically suspended because of the war, so that it is not strange that his death date is missing. The widow Lucy and the sons, Ebenezer and Thomas Rix Tracy seem to have stayed on the farm until about 1792, when Ebenezer moved to Lysle, N.Y. Thomas Rix Tracy and hismother seem to have remained until aobut 1796, when they also wen to the State of New York. The greater part of the original farm passed into the possession of ABner Smith who in 1799 sold it to Lemuel Stocking."</p>
