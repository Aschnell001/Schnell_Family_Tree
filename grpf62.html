<div class="gg-fttxt"><p>A note first. A FAGr memorial for Captain Benedict5 Arnold was not found to be included on FAGr. Capt. Benedict5 is the father of Major General Benedict6 Arnold, not Benedict4 Arnold that had been listed on FAGr. Following, are citations obtained from the reference "Incidents In the Life and Times of Stukeley Westcote" (1886), Page 14. Author: Bullock, J. Russell, (Publisher Private). This reference includes the Arnold family lineage starting with Damaris2 Westcott 1621–1679, wife of Benedict Arnold Sr 1615–1678. The author concludes his Arnold family citations at Benedict6 Arnold with "His descendants are now living in London and Canada, but we do not trace them."<br>
<br>
Captain Benedict5 Arnold, was born about 1719 and died after 1760, after his wife, Hannah Lathrop King Arnold. The headstone of Benedict5, and that of his young son, were removed by a crowd of town's people after Major General Benedict6 Arnold betrayed this country.<br>
<br>
"Benedict5 Arnold, of Benedict4, with his brother Oliver5, removed from Newport to Norwich, Conn., about 1730. He took the freeman's oath there in 1739. He as well as his brother were coopers by trade, but being of an active and enterprising nature, Benedict5 soon left his trade and engaged in mercantile pursuits, and began to take an interest in public affairs. He was chosen collector of taxes, one of the selectmen, and a captain in the militia. In 1752 he was one of the commissioners to build the "Congregational Meeting House." In 1733, November 8, he married widow Hannah King, whose maiden name was Lathrop. She died in 1759, aged 59 years. She is said to have been a "pattern of patience, piety, and virtue." One of her letters, written 1754, April 12, to her son, who afterwards became General Benedict, is full of good advice, and shows her deep interest in the future welfare of this then wayward youth. Their children were as follows, but it is said that only two of them, Benedict and Hannah, lived to maturity:"<br>
