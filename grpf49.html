IMMIGRANT, ABT. 1643<br>
<br>
A BIOGRAPHY OF JOHN CHURCHILL (c.1620-1663), by Laurence Overmire (9G Grandson), genealogist and family historian, updated August 2020:<br>
<br>
John Churchill was born about 1620, presumably in England. His parentage is unknown, though there are unsubstantiated claims on the Internet.<br>
<br>
John emigrated to Plymouth Colony, MA, about 1643, and married Hannah Pontus on December 18, 1644, in Plymouth. He was propounded a freeman in 1650, and admitted in 1651.<br>
<br>
A planter, John and Hannah made their home at 'Hobs Hole' in Plymouth. Today, Hobs Hole, the oldest separate neighborhood in Plymouth, is also called Wellinglsey or Jabez Corner.<br>
<br>
John's father-in-law William Pontus was one of the Leiden Separatists. John's sister-in-law Mary Pontus married Philippe De La Noye (Delano), a French Huguenot and another of the Leiden Separatists, from whom Franklin Delano Roosevelt is descended. Their son Samuel Delano married Elizabeth Standish, the granddaughter of Captain Myles Standish, as well as of John and Priscilla (Mullins) Alden.<br>
<br>
John and Hannah had 6 children:<br>
1) Joseph (b. 1647, m. Sarah Hicks)<br>
2) Hannah (b. 12 Nov. 1649, m. John Drew)<br>
3) Eleazer (b. 20 Apr. 1652, m. Mary _______, Mary Doty)<br>
4) Mary (b. 1 Aug. 1654, m. Thomas Doty)<br>
5) John (1657-1723, m. Rebecca Delano)<br>
<br>
John died young, about 43 years of age, on January 1, 1663, in Plymouth. His wife Hannah married a second time to Giles Rickard as his second wife. She died December 22, 1690, in Hob's Hole, aged 67.<br>

WARNING: John's parentage is unknown. His birth date and place are unknown. Some show he was the son of John (c. 1603-1682) and Sarah Churchill, but the evidence is lacking. For an extensive study of John Churchill, see Wikitree.<br>

<br>
FROM WIKITREE, 2018:<br>
For many years the parentage of John Churchill has been a mystery that no one has been able to solve. Many un-sourced attempts have been made to connect this John Churchill to his English parentage. All are derived from bogus information found on the internet which has compounded the problem severely over the years. The problem continues to this day. This profile has been heavily researched by certified genealogists and professional researchers, over many years, who have not been able to connect John, the colonist, to his English family. His birth date and place are unknown. The Muston, Dorset and 1613 information circulating on the web is known to be a falsehood. The fact is, no documented proof of the parentage of John Churchill of The Plymouth Colony exists. ( 2017)</p>
