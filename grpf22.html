John Cole was the son of Boston's innkeeper, Samuel Cole. He was married in Boston on 30 December 1651 to Susanna Hutchinson, the daughter of William and Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson, and the only survivor of the massacre in which her mother and many of her siblings were killed.<br>
<br>
John was born in Essex County, England, either on Mersea or in Dedham.<br>
He came to Boston in 1630 on the Winthrop Fleet with his father Samuel Cole and mother Ann. The family lived on Washington Street, not far from Governor Winthrop and the Hutchinson family.<br>
<br>
On December 30, 1651, he married Susanna Hutchinson after a pre-nuptial agreement had been signed by his father Samuel Cole and Susanna’s elder brother Edward Hutchinson. Susanna had recently lived with the Lenape Indians for 8 years and was still adjusting to Colonial life.<br>
<br>
The Hutchinson family had been very successful in their trading company and had acquired 600 acres of land in what was to become North Kingstown, Rhode Island. They needed someone to manage this land and therefore gave it to Susanna to have John and Susanna manage it. By 1663 they had moved to that land.<br>
<br>
In 1668, John Cole was appointed Magistrate under the government of Connecticut. No doubt, since he was educated, he was appointed a Magistrate for the area, which at that time was claimed by both Rhode Island and Connecticut. This led to difficulties for John, particularly from Rhode Island officials. He and three others were appointed to this office by Connecticut, and the inhabitants of Wickford, an adjacent village in North Kingstown, were called upon to yield obedience to them, and not to the Rhode Island officers. In 1670 he was arrested by the Rhode Island authorities for taking office under Connecticut.<br>
<br>
In 15 Jul 1670 - He, John Cole, having said before the Rhode Island Governor and Council, that he had not yet taken an engagement to any office under Connecticut, but did not know how soon might, and also did own that he did forewarn the Rhode Island Conservators of the Peace from acting in his Majesty's name, etc.: he was committed to the Sergeant, till the next court meeting, and was to find bail for £20, to answer for said contempt. The warning which he gave to the Conservators of the Peace, related to a matter of disputed jurisdiction between the two colonies, in the calling of a jury of inquest in the case of murder of Walter House, of Wickford. He was on the jury in the case of the murder of Walter House by Thomas Flounders, the jury being called by Connecticut authorities.<br>
<br>
On 29 Jul 1679, John and forty-one other inhabitants of Narragansett, petitioned the King, praying that he "would put an end to these differences about the government thereof, which hath been so fatal to the prosperity of the place; animosities still arising in people's minds as they stand affected to this or that government."<br>
<br>
On 28 Jun 1682 – John Cole was appointed Conservator of the Peace. He now acted on behalf of the Rhode Island authorities.<br>
<br>
John and Susanna had eleven children: Susannah, Samuel, John, Mary, Ann, Francis, Elizabeth, John, Hannah, William and Elisha. William inherited the land.<br>
<br>
The Cole family members are no doubt buried on what is now known as Cole Lot. It is located on a knoll in the woods off Route 1A. There are many gravestones visible, but only a very few are legible.</p>
